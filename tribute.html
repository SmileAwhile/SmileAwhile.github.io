                <h5>Linus Torvalds came to Perth for the 2003 Australian Linux conference, and was a great sport. He remarked that it was a nice change from penguins</h5>

                      <h4>Linus Torvads, Early Days:</h4>
                        <p>Helsinki born, Linus Torvalds gained interest in computers and started programming in 1981 at age 11.  Version 1.0 of the Linux OS was released in 1994 only a few years after receiving his copy of MINIX.  Linux started out as just a side project Linus was working on for himself.  The act of Linus sharing his source code is what made it possible for Linux to be the ubiquitous powerhouse we know it to be today.</p>
                          <h4>A Brief Intro to Linux:</h4>
                            <p>Linux powers the majority of servers on the internet.  Linux is in practically every embedded device, from dvd players to the computer system in cars to coffee makers. The popular Android mobile OS is a Linux-based OS.  The only Operating System market not dominated by Linux (yet) is the Desktop market, which is ironic as Torvalds originally intended Linux to be a desktop Operating System.</p>
                                <h4>Main Accomplishments:</h4>
                                  <p>As of 2006, about 2 percent of the Linux kernel was written by Torvalds.  Due to the sheer number of contributors, this 2 percent is one of the largest percentages froma  single contributer.  In 2012, however, Torvalds stated his contribution is mostly merging code.  Also, Torvalds pioneered git as a replacement for BitKeeper after coming under fire for using the proprietary software.</p>
